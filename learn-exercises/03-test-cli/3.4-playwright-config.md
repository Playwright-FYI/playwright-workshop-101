## 3.4 Understand TestConfig

Let's start by learning about Playwright Test _configuration_. 
 - The [`playwright.config.ts`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#basic-configuration) file defines the default Test Runner configuration. 
 - The [TestConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig) API describes the available configuration properties for customization.
 - The [Playwright Test CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) lets you override config properties or file location at runtime.

Let's see what the default configuration file provided by Playwright (on first setup) looks like. The `playwright.config.ts` snippet below was simplified for clarity.

```js
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({

  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',

  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },

  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },

    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },

    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
  ],

  /* Run your local dev server before starting the tests */
  // webServer: {
  //   command: 'npm run start',
  //   url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
  //   reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  // },
});
```
We can refer to the [Basic Configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration#basic-configuration) documentation to understand what this does:
 - [`testDir`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-test-dir) = top-level directory to scan recursively for test files.
 - [`fullyParallel`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-fully-parallel) = decide if all tests in all files should run in parallel
 - [`forbidOnly`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-forbid-only) = exit with error if `test.only` is used (e.g., useful on CI)
 - [`retries`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-retries) = max #retries per test (useful for _web-first assertions_)
 - [`workers`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-workers) = max # of concurrent worker processes (for parallelizing tests)
 - [`reporter`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-reporter) = select from available reporter options ( built-in and custom)
 - [`use`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-use) = set _[global options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options)_ for all tests (can be [overriden](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options#configuration-scopes) at project or test scope)
 - [`projects`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-projects) = run tests in _multiple configurations_ (think browsers, emulators, options)
 - [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-web-server) = launch webserver(s) hosting app(s) to test (waits till ready to start)

We'll revisit the _webServer_ option in a future exercise when we build the sample application test suite. For now, let's try modifying one or more of these properties to see how this works.
