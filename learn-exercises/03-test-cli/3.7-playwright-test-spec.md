## 3.7 Understand Test Spec

### 3.7.1 Reset To Default Config

ðŸ›‘ | Before we continue - note that we made a lot of changes to the `playwright.config.ts` file in the previous section. Let's reverse it and get back to our default configuration state. 

The easiest way is to _copy back_ the original file as follows.

```bash
cp tests-examples/orig-playwright.config.ts  playwright.config.ts
```
Run a quick test to make sure that worked.

```bash
npx playwright test
```
You should see that all 6 tests pass.

```bash
Running 6 tests using 3 workers
  6 passed (8.0s)
```
Excellent - we are now ready to talk about Test Specifications!

### 3.7.2 View Example Specification

The default test runs on the `tests/example.spec.ts` specification. Let's unpack that to see what it contains:

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Click the get started link.
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();

  // Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

If you've done _test-driven development_ or _end-to-end testing_, the structure and format of the tests should be familiar. But you may see a few new concepts too. Before we dive into those, let's talk about test structure.
