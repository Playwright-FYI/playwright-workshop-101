## 3.9 Understand Test Structure

We can look at either of the two Test Specification snippets above (the first from `example.spec.ts`, the second from `demo-todo-app.spec.ts`) for this discussion - but let's use the second one since it has a bit more detail that is relevant.

### 3.9.1 Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

Playwright tests generally follow the [Arrange-Act-Assert](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/) pattern:
 1. **Arrange** - sets up the environment for the test. This can include providing the right fixtures, but also running `beforeEach`/`beforeAll` hooks that set up the initial state for that test.
 1. **Act** - these are the steps within the test that _locate_ the right elements to interact with, and then take _actions_ on them. For instance, the test may [locate a button](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-get-by-role) and then [click it](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests#basic-actions). Other actions include _check/uncheck_ (checkboxes), _fill_ (forms), _hover_ (mouseover), _focus_ (on element), _press_ (single key) etc.
 1. **Assert** - these statements validate expected outcomes from the actions. Playwright supports [web-first assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions) where [generic assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-genericassertions) (using `expect`) can be coupled with [async matchers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions)(for the `Locator`) to make sure that the target element is ready before evaluating the asserted condition.

Once you understand this, it becomes easier to understand, author, and refine, your test specifications using Playwright tooling. 



### 3.9.2 Pattern in Practice

Let's see these concepts in action by reviewing the example spec from section 4.2.

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Click the get started link.
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();

  // Expects page to have a heading with the name of Installation.
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();
});
```
1. (Arrange) - there are no explicit hooks in this test spec, but we'll talk about how `page` is a [Fixture](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures) that also supports this goal.
2. (Act) - the `page.goto` is an example of a [Navigation](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests#navigation) action where the browser automates the user action of navigating to that URL.
2. (Assert) - the `expect.(<locator>).toBeVisible()` is an example of a [LocatorAssertion](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions#locator-assertions-to-be-visible) where Playwright will wait for the located element to be ready (using retries) before evaluating the assertion (is it visible?).

With this simple example, you know three powerful concepts in Playwright Testing:
 * [Fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) - for establishing environment and _test isolation_. 
 * [Locators](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators) - for finding elements with _auto-wait and auto-retry_.
 * [Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions) - for validating outcomes of automated actions _web-assertions_.

Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the documentation for those three features and APIs - and you should be all set to dive into _designing and authoring_ an end-to-end specification for the sample application.
