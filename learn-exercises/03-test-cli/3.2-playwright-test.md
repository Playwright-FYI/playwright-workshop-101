## 3.2 Run Example Test Spec

Recall that we reset our `testDir` to point to the `tests/` directory. That means the Playwright Test runner will only find specifications within the `tests/*` sub-tree. Right now that contains a single file - `example.spec.ts` - which is provided by default when you initialize a new Playwright project.

Let's run the test. 

```bash
npx playwright test
```
We get the following output - indicating that all tests passed. But what does `6 tests` and `3 workers` mean given we only had one test specification?

```bash
Running 6 tests using 3 workers
  6 passed (8.2s)

To open last HTML report run:
  npx playwright show-report
```
