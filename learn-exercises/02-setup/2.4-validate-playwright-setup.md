## 2.4 Validate Playwright Setup

The repository has been setup to have a Playwright project scaffolded at the root of the repository, with the target sample application source in the `app-todomvc/` directory. The Playwright setup consists of _four_ key files or folders:
 1. `playwright.config.ts` - the Playwright Test Configuration file.
 2. `tests/` -   top-level folder that Playwright searches recursively, for tests
 3. `tests-examples/` - staging folder with demo test scripts to try out.
 4. `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` - GitHub Action for automating tests

Playwright releases a new version every month. Let's update to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
```

Once you update to the latest version of Playwright you will then need to install the latest browsers as these are not installed by default when installing Playwright.

```bash
npx playwright install
```
