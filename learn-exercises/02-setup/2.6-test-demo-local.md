## 2.6 Validate Test With Sample App

Since the sample application is _exactly the same_ as the deployed application, we should be able to run the tests against the _local preview endpoint_ and have them pass. Right?

Let's try it out. To simplify this exercise at this stage, I simply made a copy of the original spec in `tests-examples/demo-todo-local.spec.ts` - then changed the target url to `http://localhost:4200` (the preview URL for our dev server).

Let's try this out. Note that I am assuming you still have your sample app running locally from Step 3. If not, first start that up as we did before, in one terminal. 

Once it is running, then run Playwright Test as follows - note that this time, for fun, we've added an option `--project chromium`. This tells the Playwright Test runner to run this only for the single browser (chromium) instead of all three (default option).

Run the demo-todo-local test - default 1 browser:

```bash
npx playwright test demo-todo-local --project chromium
```
You should now see only 24 tests were run using 3 workers as tests are only run on one browser, therefore less tests are being run.

```bash
Running 24 tests using 3 workers
  24 passed (13.0s)
```
