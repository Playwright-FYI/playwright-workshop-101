Congratulations for completing unit 2!

ðŸ›‘ | Don't Forget To Reset `testDir`

In Step 5, we decided to change the `testDir` property to "." so we could find test specifications in the entire repo. Let's change that back to the default `./tests` value so we can reset our environment for starting the next exercise.

Your `playwright.config.ts` should now read:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  /* Run tests in files in parallel */
  fullyParallel: true,
  ..
})
```
