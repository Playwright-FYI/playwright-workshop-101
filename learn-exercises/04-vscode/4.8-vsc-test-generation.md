## 4.8 Generating Tests

[CodeGen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro) will auto generate your tests for you as you perform actions in the browser - making it the simplest way to get started authoring tests for complex workflows. The Codegen support in VS Code is more feature-rich than from command-line, and is easier to use given we are already in an editor environment. _This is also best demonstrated when in the guided project coming up later_. For now, get a quick overview of the debugging support in this video.
