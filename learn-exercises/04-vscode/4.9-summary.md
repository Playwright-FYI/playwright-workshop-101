## 4.9 Summary

In this section you learned how to use the Visual Studio Code extension to find and run tests, and also how to use UI Mode to get a more visual experience for debugging tests, and how to use Watch Mode to get a live reload experience for seamless test-driven development. 

And we learned how Visual Studio Code provides richer tools for _Generating Tests_ using the `Record a New Test`, `Pick Locator`, and `Record at Cursor` features. Now - it's time to **apply** our _Playwright Fundamentals_ learnings in a guided project to build an end-to-end test specification for our sample app!
