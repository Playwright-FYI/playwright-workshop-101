## 4.2 Install Playwright Extension

If you are running this workshop in a dev container (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) then you're already covered!! The default `devcontainer.json` _configuration-as-code_ solution lists this extension as one of the required customizations for VS Code.

If you are running this workshop in your local environment without a dev container, then [install the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) from the VS Code Marketplace. Once installed, you should spot a beaker icon in the left-hand side of your VS Code window as shown in the screenshot. Note how the extension _automatically_ detects and gathers the test specifications in your project.
