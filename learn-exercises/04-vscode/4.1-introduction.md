## 4.1 Introduction

In the previous section, we walked through core concepts related to the Playwright Test Configuration and Playwright Test Specification - but we used the _Playwright Commandline_ (CLI) for executing our tests and viewing reports. 

What if we could do all this _within our Visual Studio Code environment_ and have a more **visual** interaction process for authoring, running, and debugging, our tests. 

With the [Playwright Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright), you get a superior developer experience _and some unique tooling features_ that will soon make this your preferred way to interact with the Playwright Test runner. Let's jump in and take a tour.

The [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) have a comprehensive tutorial with the video walkthrough below that I recommend you watch in your own time. In this lesson, we'll try to walk through a subset of these exercises to get you familiar with usage.
