## 1.6 Playwright Core Tools

We'll also be learning to use a number of Playwright tools - both from the command-line and from within Visual Studio Code. For reference, here are some key developer tools we'll explore - with a description of the role they play in a testing workflow.

| Tool | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Playwright Test (CLI)](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) | The Playwright Test Runner and default CLI|
| [Playwright Extension (VS Code)](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) | The Playwright Extension for Visual Studio Code|
| | |
| [Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro)| Playwright Test Generator (for automated authoring) |
| [UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode)| Playwright Time Travel Experience (with Watch Mode, Trace viewing and more) |
| [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro)| Graphical UI for exploring recorded Playwright traces. |
|[Built-in Reporters](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#built-in-reporters) | Flexible reporting options, with support for customization. |
| [Continuous Integration](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci) | Support for wide range of CI providers (with sample config). |
| [VS Code Debugger](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#vs-code-debugger)| Powerful debugging support using VS Code Extension.|
|[Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector)| Powerful debugging support from Playwright Commandline. |

In many cases, the same functionality will be available from both the CLI and the VS Code Extension. We'll explore the Playwright Test (CLI) option briefly, but recommend making Visual Studio Code Extension your preferred option given richer capabilities and a more streamlined developer experience.
