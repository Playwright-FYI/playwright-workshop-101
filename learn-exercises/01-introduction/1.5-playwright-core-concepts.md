## 1.5 Playwright Core Concepts

In the following exercises, we'll learn how to perform a number of test automation tasks using Playwright. To set the stage, here are a few core terms and concepts to keep in mind. 

| Concept | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [TestConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig)| Configure Playwright Test Runner using File (static) or API (dynamic)|
| [TestProject](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects)| Logical group of tests running same TestConfig. Can be defined by filter.|
| [Test Timeout](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts)| Global (per test run), Default (per test), Expect Timeouts, Fixture Timeouts |
| [Fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures)| Core to Playwright _test isolation_. Set environment - see [built-in](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures) options. |
| [Navigation](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests#actions)| Using `page.goto()` [options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-goto) to craft multi-page testing workflows |
| [Locators](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators)| Core to Playwright auto-wait and auto-retry. Action _finds_ target elements.|
| [Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions)| Core to Playwright _validation_ of expected outcomes based on actions.|
| [Annotations](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations)| Tag tests to provide added context to deal with failures, focus, flakiness.|
| [`use` Options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options)| Configure Browser (project) or BrowserContext (context) within _scope_. |
| [Page Object Models](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom)| Represent UI components by "Objects", associate testing logic for reuse |
| [Project Dependencies](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown) | Configure global _setup and teardown_ in a project (dependency) that can be run before/after your projects. |
| [Mock APIs](https://playwright.dev/docs/mock) | Support mocking of API requests and responses to allow controlled validation of application behaviors (without accessing the real endpoint) |
| | |

Their purpose and usage will become clearer when you work through the exercises.
