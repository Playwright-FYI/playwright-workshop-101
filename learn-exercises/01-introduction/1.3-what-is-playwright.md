## 1.3 What is Playwright?

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is an open-source framework for _reliable_ end-to-end testing for modern web apps. It is relatively new (released in 2020) but maintains an active [release schedule](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#version-138), adding new features and fixing bugs at a rapid pace. 

Playwright support multiple languages - meaning that you can write tests in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java or C#. This workshop will focus on JavaScript, but the concepts should be applicable to other languages as well.
