Use Playwright to create, refine, debug, and run, an end-to-end test specification for a modern web application ([ToDo MVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc)) using a local development server. Then instrument the source repository with GitHub actions for automated end-to-end testing on every commit and pull request.

### Learning Objectives

In this module you will:
 - Instrument a modern web application with Playwright end-to-end tests
 - Author tests using Playwright's _Codegen_ tools.
 - Debug tests using Playwright's _UI Mode_ with watch capability.
 - Run tests using Playwright's _Test Runner_ from command-line or VS Code.
 - Automate tests in headless mode using _GitHub Actions_ 

## Pre-Requisites
- GitHub account (with GitHub Codespaces activated)
- Familiarity with Node.js and ecosystem
- Familiarity with testing concepts
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code and Extensions.


## Introduction

**ToDoMVC** is a well-known [reference application sample](https://todomvc.com/) from the [TasteJS project](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc). The project implements a basic ToDo application using a variety of MV* frameworks, allowing you to explore best practices for each and select the right framework for your needs. 

In _this guided project_ we'll be using a modified version of the [typescript-react](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/typescript-react) example that was originally hosted [here](https://todomvc.com/examples/typescript-react/#/). Our modified reflects the official [ToDo MVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc) demo maintained by the Playwright team which includes minor tweaks that implement best practices for modern web app testing.

## Application Scenarios

For this guided project, the application source can be found in the `app-todomvc` project folder of this repository. In the next unit, we'll walk through the setup and validation of the application and the Playwright testing harness. 

For now, let's talk briefly about the features (user scenarios) demonstrated by the application.

1. Scenario: User adds new ToDo items
    - Users can add one or more items to the list
    - Text inputs should be cleared once the item is added
    - New items get added to the bottom of the list
    
2. Scenario: User Marks All ToDo items as complete
    - 

3. Scenario: User Updates an existing ToDo item

4. Scenario: User Edits an existing ToDo item

5. Scenario: ToDo Counter shows current
